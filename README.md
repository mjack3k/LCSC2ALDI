# LCSC2ALDI
Create labels for parts bought on LCSC for ALDI small parts containers

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Made as a fun little project to help me manage my electronic parts for DIY projects.
The goal is to have a table with labels that you can print, cut and glue on the drawers of
small parts magazine, like the one here:

The project is not ready yet - we can parse the CSV file (exported BOM from LCSC),
and got general idea how to proceed, but it still needs some work.
Doesn't produce any usable output (yet!).
